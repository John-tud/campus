  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <li>Founder</li>
  <p>  Wheels on Fire was founded by our ambitious CEO John O'Reilly. Born as the youngest of four boys, and raised by a single father, John had to fight for every scrap from a young age. This gave birth to his drive and ruthlessness, key ingredients to be successful in business. John grew his passion for cars through his father, who was a mechanic and loved bringing his sons to work. It was here that John and his brothers learned the importance of hard work. </p>
