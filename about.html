        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Fire Wheels is a family run business which was started in 1956 by Michael O'Reilly. Orginally just a car junkie who loved fixing up cars in his shed, turned his dream into reality. When Fire Wheels first opened business was booming, with the new influx of cars entering into Ireland. As time passed on, Michael passed the family run mechanic to his eldest son Mark O'Reilly in the year 1975. Mark always had the dream of expanding his fathers business to different parts of Dublin. So in the same year he opened up a second mechanic shop in Castleknock Dublin. It turned out to be a huge success, allowing the business improve and expand further then ever before.</p>

        <br>    
        <p>Throughout the years Fire Wheels had its ups and downs. The family run business was extremely affected in the 2008 finacial crash that hit Ireland. It lead to the closure of up to half of its stores. Fire Wheels had nearly declard bankruptcy numerous of times but Mark was able to keep the business afloat during this turbulent time. Thanks to Marks extreme motivation and dedication to the business, it had survied the finacial crash which deveasted millions of others.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After 50 years of service and dedication to the car industry, Mark stepped away from Fire Wheels in 2025. He gave way to his second eeldest son John O'Reilly, the current owner of Fire Wheels. John a university graduate in Business Managment had different ideas for the business. His idea was to change Fire Wheels into a modifiaction centre for cars and also offer to sell luxury cars.
