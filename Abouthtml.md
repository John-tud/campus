  <h2>Our Founder</h2>
   <p> Wheels on Fire was founded by our ambitious CEO, John O'Reilly. Born as the youngest of four boys and raised by a single father, John learned the value of resilience and determination early in life. Growing up in a household where every opportunity had to be earned, he developed a relentless drive and sharp business acumen. Qualities that have become the cornerstone of Wheels on Fire's success. John's passion for cars was sparked by his father, a skilled mechanic who always had his sons in the shop, here they absorbed the intricacies of automotive repair and the importance of hard work. Those early days tinkering with engines alongside his brothers shaped John's vision for a business that combines technical excellence with an unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction. </p>

   <h2> About the buisness </h2>
  <p>Founded in 2006, Wheels on Fire originated as a humble mechanic shop in Dublin, Ireland. What started as a small operation driven by John's vision and hands-on expertise has grown into a thriving enterprise with three large, state-of-the-art locations across the region. Each shop is equipped with cutting-edge tools and staffed by highly trained technicians who share John's dedication to quality and precision. Specializing in automotive repair, maintenance, customization, and now the sale and resale of automobiles, Wheels on Fire has built a reputation for reliability, transparency, and exceptional service. </p>
